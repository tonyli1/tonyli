  <p>
    As part of a graduate course in User Centered Design in Winter 2022, our team of 5 from the University of Washington's
    HCDE Masters program had 9 weeks to design and run usability testing for WA Notify's self declaration feature, which
    allows users to report positive COVID-19 test results and send exposure notifications to other users who were in recently
    in close proximity to them. This was in partnership with UW's Clinical Informatics Research Group and the Washington State
    Department of Health for the WA Notify app, also known as WA Exposure Notifications.

    We conducted a user study for each OS, 5 participants for each.

  <h4 class="w3-center">Interaction Maps and Prototypes</h4>
    <div class="w3-row">
    <p>
      After working with the client to form the research questions, our team created two <b>interaction maps</b> based on
      the user flow, one map for each of the mobile OS's (iOS and Android).

      Based on these flows, we created a digital prototype in Figma for each OS and devised a study kit including the following items:
      screening questionnaire, communications template, facilitations scripts for interviews, consent agreement, pre- and post-test
      questionnaires, data collection methods of recording calls, and templates to document responses (including standardized Likert
      scales for the post-test questions).

      For recruitment, we utilized UserTesting and a convernience sample of personal connections, screening for the following:
      participants who lived in Washington state during the COVID-19 pandemic, used English as their personal phone's system
      language (since our prototype was in English), and used an iOS or Android as their primary personal phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conducted these semi-structured interviews online, devising two tasks for users to <b>think aloud</b> as they completed:
      reporting an at-home positive COVID-19 test result through WA Notify, and reporting a positive test result through WA Notify
      from a clinic that provides a verification code, utilizing the OS prototype matching the OS of their primary phone.

    Once we finished collecting data, we collaboratively compiled the findings and created an <b>affinity map</b> to group the findings.
    Then we devised a system for calculating severity of each issue and finding by factoring in the following: impact criticality,
    and frequency. These severity scores prioritized our findings, which we compiled into a report and presented to the client as
    well as our class.

        <li>WA Notify's association with the State Department of Health builds trust and confidence about
          sharing test results.

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-small">
      <ul>
        <li>Wording and terminology lead to confusion about the functionality (verification code, random ID, etc).</li>
        <li>(iOS only): Users who know about Exposure Notifications don't know where the feature is located in their phone.</li>
        <li>Users are confused and concerned about WA-Notify's privacy policy and use of data.</li>
        <li>Non-users are doubtful about whether the app is worthwhile (effective and worth their time).</li>
        <li>Navigating away from WA Notify caused confusion (separate instructions for code request, context switching).</li>

      <p>
        This was my first design project working with an external client. It was surprisingly seamless and flexible
        working with the client's needs in the scope of an academic class project, while also exciting to
        work on design problems in practice for tangible user needs. I would be interested to see how design
        scope can expand beyond a class project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given more time and resources, we would have tested a larger sample size, conducted more
        iterative testing, and worked towards a closer collaboration with the client for more in-depth testing and
        quantitative data (such as setting up a more realistic test environment for the mobile product instead of a
        desktop prototype).
